One of the major goals of this class is to understand how wireless systems research is done. 
To this end, the project is an important component of CSE610, where you can get your hands dirty 
by proposing an interesting research idea based on your knowledge or experience from the course readings
and then realizing your idea! 

## 1. Teams:

As far as possible, you should work in teams of two or three.
Working in a team is a lot of fun and, most importantly, much more productive.
Solid collaboration often leads to impactful research and it is very 
important for you to develop the ability to collaborate with others.
Free free to use the class Slack channel to find project parterns. 

## 2. Project Ideas:
We strongly encourage you to propose your own project ideas based on the content of this course.
But, as a one-semester long course, we can only cover a small fraction of research topics in our class, including the lectures and research papers.
Even for the topics we cover, there will certainly be other relevant work that you should take a look at.
Therefore, please search the related literature as extensively as you can to figure out what has been done or is known,
base on which you can figure what else you can do to improve the state-of-the-art.

We will also provide a list of suggested project ideas before the proposal deadline. 
We note that our suggestions only points out possible directions you can explore,
on top of which, you still need to propose a concrete plan for your research project.


## 3. Project Proposal:
One- to two-page proposals (details below) are due by Friday, March 17, 2023. 
It is important that you read related background material before turning in the proposal.
We will read the proposals carefully over the following few days and get back to you by Slack if we have any questions. 
Please don't wait for us to get back to you; **get started as soon as possible!**
You have about two months to carry out the project, 
which is ample if your proposal is focused and you start early, but not otherwise.

A crisp one- to two-page write-up (12 point font or greater) for the proposal should contain the following items.

<ol>
<li> Project title (a detailed title is better than a vague one; you can always change it later if you don't like it!) and names of the team members with email addresses.
</li>

<li> A clear statement of the problem: a one-sentence summary followed by a one-paragraph explanation. This should identify the goal, question, or hypothesis you're addressing.
</li>

<li> A clear statement of your methodology. I.e., how are you going to solve the problems you've raised and motivated in the previous paragraph? Create a system architecture diagram that highlights the different components of your project and how these components fit together in your end-to-end system
</li>

<li> A statement of plan and schedule, to convince us (and yourself!) that you can complete this by the end of the term.
</li>

<li> Expected deliverables & Metrics for evaluation: What are the quantitative metrics that you intend to use to evaluate your project? E.g., battery should last >10 hours, accuracy should be <10 cm, etc.
</li>

<li> A list of resources you need to accomplish your work, with special emphasis on important components you don't yet have access to. Be as clear as you can in your requirements and we will work towards getting what you need as quickly as possible. If your request can't be accommodated for any reason, we will try to get back to you about it as soon as we find out.
</li>

<li> Any other questions you have or clarifications you need from us. 
</li>
</ol>

## Project Progress Report
The progress report is due on Friday, May, 8, 2023. 
It should explain your approach, related/prior work, any preliminary results you might have obtained, 
and why you believe you are on the right track. 
It may also include material from the proposal after you had the chance to update it based on our feedback.

## Final Report
The final project report is due on Friday, May, 19, 2023.
In the report, please include a paragraph to describe each team member's contribution to the project.
